# Project 1 - data structure calculator


 overvirew :
            A calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
            More sophisticated calculators can handle exponent ial operations, roots, logarithm s, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions. Internally, some calculators actually perform all of these functions by repeated processes of addition operators are using in calculator. In this project i have develop the data structure calculator has more options like int,string,list,tuple,dictionairy,set perations.
 
            
step 1 :
         integer contains 15 operations,string contains 15 operations , tuple contain 10 operations,set contain 10 operations ,dictionairy contain 10 opeartions.code write for each operations.
 
step 2 :
       perform error handling has been use in the program like try and except. eg. in int operation user give wrong input try and except concept will work.
       
step 3 :
       program using while loop.eg condition ask user is quit or continue quit means outside the loop it will come.
       
step 4 :
       using librairy modules can use to short the lines of code.
